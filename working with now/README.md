### About

Colorant is a highly efficient color aimbot designed to rapidly scan for a range of purple color of the valorant enemy player outlines on your screen and precisely aim/shoot at it, without any interference with the game memory or files of Valorant.

Unlike conventional video game cheats that rely on the process memory to function, Colorant adopt a unique approach by avoiding any memory reading altogether. This innovative approach has the potential to remain undetectable by anti-cheat mechanisms that typically attempt to block memory reads. Additionally, sending input to the video game without triggering any flags can be a challenging aspect to consider.

The primary objective of this project is to showcase a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential of Colorant's novel approach to aimbot technology.
